# web_scraping
I have developed a project centered on web scraping, specifically focused on extracting data from LinkedIn. The script is designed to scrape information from LinkedIn profiles, encompassing essential details such as name, location, and profile URL. As the project evolves over time, additional features will be incorporated to enhance its functionality.
